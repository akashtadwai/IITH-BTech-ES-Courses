# Stoichy

**Stoichy** is a  language that can be used to balance complex chemical equations defined by the user. This is a group Project as a part of Compilers course at IIT Hyderabad.

## Installation  

We have written most of the Project in [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/) hence the user needs to install Ocaml dependencies.  

As we have written Code generation in Java, Java is a prereq. For installing java, follow
<https://linuxize.com/post/install-java-on-ubuntu-18-04/>

 To install [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/) and all the dependencies of python we used for the project run the [prereqs.sh](https://github.com/akashtadwai/stoichy/blob/master/prereqs.sh) bash script in **sudo** mode.  

* ```$ sudo su```
* ```$ bash prereqs.sh```  

## Instructions to Compile

1. ```$ make```  

2. ```$ ./stoichy <input_file>```  

3. ```$ make clean # To clean all files```

To run all the tests at once and see the output run,  
> ```$ bash run_tests.sh```
