Instructions:

1. Accuracy we got according the public leaderboard is 93.896

2. We have made our Kaggle Notebooks public, We have saved our model weights to reduce the training time so that user could run them directly.
    Final model with saved weights: https://www.kaggle.com/vintareethu/94-8model
    Final model which used for training: https://www.kaggle.com/vintareethu/trainingpart

3. Input file names (should be in same directory):

4. For running the code locally go to the directory of containing all the files,

   1. Running preloaded weight files (to reduce the time to train).
        $ python3 ES18BTECH11028_1.py
   2. Running (with training) 
        $ python3 ES18BTECH11028_2.py
