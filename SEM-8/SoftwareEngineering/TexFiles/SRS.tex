\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
Conference Management System is a web-based application that handles a variety of aspects of conference management, including user registration, conference registration, paper submissions by authors, reviewer registration, papers assignment for reviewers, review submission, and conference notifications. This document is meant to delineate the features of Conference Management System, to serve as a guide to the developers on one hand and a software validation document for the prospective client on other.

\section{Scope}

    \item Author submission of paper for a conference.
    \item Allocating submitted papers for reviewers. Display reviews submitted by reviewers to authors.
    \item Send notifications related to conference to users (i.e authors, reviewers)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Out of scope:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Doesn't manage offline conference management i.e Accommodation, Conference event Scheduling etc.

\underline{\textbf{Pre Conditions}}: Portal should be active. CC should be logged into account.\\
\underline{\textbf{Main Scenario}}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item After the paper deadline, CC can see paper, reviews for each submission made.
    \item Analysing all the data CC can "Accept" or "Reject" along with optional text for the decision.
    \item Once CC makes the decision, clicking on "Submit" will submit the decision.
\end{enumerate}
\underline{\textbf{Alternate Scenario}}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clicking on the submit button with incompletely filled form will raise an error.
    \item If the CC, clicks the "submit" after crossing the deadline, an error message will be displayed.
\end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Use cases related to Event Notifications}
\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Use Case 18 }: Reviewer invitation notification \\
\underline{\textbf{Primary actor}}: Chair\\
\underline{\textbf{Pre Conditions}}: Chair should be hosting a conference on the portal\\ 
\underline{\textbf{Main Scenario}}: Chair will send invites to the reviewers requesting them to review for the conference.

    \item \textbf{Use Case 19 }: Deadline Notifications \\
\underline{\textbf{Primary actor}}: Portal\\
\underline{\textbf{Pre Conditions}}: Portal should be active.\\ 
\underline{\textbf{Main Scenario}}: Emails will be sent to respective authors and reviewers regarding the deadlines for paper submission, camera ready submission, review deadline etc.

    \item \textbf{Use Case 20 }: Paper Acceptance Notification \\
\underline{\textbf{Primary actor}}: Portal\\
\underline{\textbf{Pre Conditions}}: Portal should be active. Paper decision deadline has been crossed. All papers have been reviewed. \\ 
\underline{\textbf{Main Scenario}}:
Portal will iterate through all the submissions of a conference, and depending on the response of reviewers, the authors of each submission will be notified regarding the acceptance status and the reviews will be revealed.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The response time should be short if you have a stable internet connection.
    \item Paper Allocation Algorithm should perform the allocation to reviewers in arguably less time.
    \item Should run well in browser environment.
\end{itemize}



\section{Design Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security:}Users should only be able to see information that is relevant to their user responsibilities. Only reviewers should have access to submitted papers, and they should be made public only after they have been published. Databases must be protected from unauthorised access, viruses, and other malicious threats.
    \item \textbf{Fault Tolerance:}Data will not get corrupted under any event of hardware failure or system crash.
    \item \textbf{Reliability:}System outages should be minimised as much as possible, especially near submission deadlines.
\end{itemize}

\section{External Interface Requirements}

\hspace{3cm} Homepage (Default root endpoint) consists of a login screen where a user can login
through their email and password. In case the user has not created an account, an
option of creating a new user account is provided which will redirect the user to a new
registration page.
In case of logged in users, a conference list of ongoing conferences is shown. In that list there are options for "Submitting Paper" and "Reviewing Paper" for that respective conference. Navigation bar consists of links for
"Home", “Submitted Papers”, “Assigned Papers”, "Notifications" and also an Option to “Create conference”.
By clicking on any conference, a new page is displayed which consists of details regarding that conference, previous submissions (if any) for author, Review draft for the papers (if any) for the reviewer.


\chapter{Future Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Including plagiarism checks as part of the portal.
    \item Add Workshops management and also can allow the feature of poster submissions.
    \item A feature of emergency reviewers can be included.
    \item More optimised paper allocation algorithm
    \item Information regarding offline conferences like venue, timings, accommodation  etc can be added.
\end{itemize}
