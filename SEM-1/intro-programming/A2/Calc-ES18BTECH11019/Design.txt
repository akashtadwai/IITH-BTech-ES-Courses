For the smooth flow and readability of the program I've took the advantage of Switch Case Statement rather than Writing all if else statements.
A switch looks much cleaner when you have to combine cases. Ifs  are quite vulnerable to errors too.
As in the question it is given that the two numbers should be taken as integers, the operations of Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication are quite Straightforward
Wheras coming to division there are two cases,i.e, when divisor is '0' and when it is non-zero. When Its '0' we throw an error other else we print the Division.
For implementing the above case I took the advantage of short hand if-else statement.
For implementing the second case (when a/b is non-zero), as both 'a' and 'b' are both integers there divsion is also integer, so, I have type casted the division
by doing something like "(a*1.0)/b" and hence printed it in a double type (double can store more bits than float).
Hence Without declaring another variable as double and assigning its value to the float divison I have implemented it directly.
