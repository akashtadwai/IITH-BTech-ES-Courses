Design Document of Prouct of even Positive integers

Choice of data types:
        1. I chose int data type for input and variable for checking whether the value is less than or equal to input
        2. I chose long long int type for storing prod because product can easily exceed 10^9.

Flow of Program:
        1. Program scans input from the user. And then, input is received.
        2. After taking the input from the user, program checks whether it is a valid input,i.e, if input is <=0 or >33 or ==1 
            it prints Error or Overflow or blank line respectively.
        3. Else then it is a valid input then the program runs a loop from 2 to check if it is even,
            prints the number if it is even and stores the value of product of even no's up to that number in a variable 
            prod which was previously initialized to '1' before.

Error Handling:
        1. If the input integer is less than or equal to 0, the program returns and error statement and ends.
        2. If the input integer is exactly 1 , then the program prints a blank line and ends.
        3. If the input integer is >33, the program prints Overflow and ends.

Pseudo Code:
            i=2,prod=1
            if(N<=0): print("Error Message")
            elif(N==1): print(newline)
            elif(N>33): print("Overflow")
            else:
                while(i<=N):
                    if (i % 2 == 0): 
                        print(i)
                        prod *= i;
                    i++
                print(prod)
