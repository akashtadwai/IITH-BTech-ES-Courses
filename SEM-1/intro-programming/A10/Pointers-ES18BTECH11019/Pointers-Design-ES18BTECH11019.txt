Design Document of Pointers

Choice of data types:
        1. I chose char array of length 11 as data type for storing string as the max. length for printing without 
            error message is 10.
        2. I have took int data type start,end pointers of string while reversing as string length is atmost 10.
        3. I have took a flag variable named 'cnt' as int, which stores the length of input string.

Flow of Program:
        1. Program scans inputs from the user. And then, input is received.
        2. I have taken input character by character,and I incremted cnt variable to store the lenght of string.
        3. If the length of string entered is less than or equal to 10, I have reversed the string and stopped execution of program.
        3. if(cnt<=10) it means that the input is a valid string, for it we should print the result.
        4. For reversing the string I have revresed it by the following algorithm,
                start=0,end=len(str-1)
                while(start<end):
                    swap(str[start],str[end])
                    start++
                    end--
        5. For swap function I used pass by reference method.
        6. If the entered input string length is greater than 10 then the error message will be printed and program
            asks for the input again from the user
Error Handling:
        1. If the input string length is other than a 10 Error message will be printed
        2. If the input is NULL string cnt will be 0 and Error message will be printed.

Pseudo Code:
            def swap(char *a,char *b):
                char temp
                temp=*a
                *a=*b
                *b=temp
            def rev(char *str):
                l=strlen(str)
                s=0,e=l-1
                while(s<e):
                    swap(&str[s],&str[e])
                    s++
                    e--
            str[11]
            input(str)
            if(strlen(str)<=10):
                rev(str)
                print(str)
            else:
                ask user for input again
