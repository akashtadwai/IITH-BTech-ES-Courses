Choice of data types:
        1. I chose int data type for inputs because they both are less than 15 as entered by user
        2. I chose long long int type for xcy calculation as 15! exceeds int data range and the data range of "long" varies with architecture of system.
           (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#64-bit_data_models)

Flow of Program:
        1. Program scans inputs from the user. And then, inputs are received.
        2. After taking the input from the user, program checks whether those are valid inputs,i.e, x>0,y>=0 x>=y
            it prints Error statement if the condition is not true.
        3. If the valid input is received, the program calculates the factorials of x,y,x-y.
        4. As the factorial(x)/factorial(y) is perfectly integer (given x>=y), we store it in xcy and then we divide xcy with factorial(x-y).
        5. Hence xcy is our answer, we print it.
        6. For calculation of factorial, I have used a function which takes a number and calculates its factorial.
        7. The return type of function is long long int for the same reason as described in Choice of Data Types.
        8. If input number to function is 0 it returns "1" as 0!=1.
        8. Else, As the basic definition of factorial of an number "n" is 1*2*3*...*n, I have used a for loop and calculated it
           by initializing fact=1, and fact*=i starting from i=2.
        9. Then finally I retuned fact from the function.

Error Handling:
        1. If the input integers x or y is >15 or x<y or x<0 or y<0, we print the error message.

Pseudo Code:
            def long long int fac(int x):
                if(x==0):    return 1
                long long int fact=1
                for(int i=2; i<=x; i++) fact*=i
                return fact
            int x,y
            long long int xcy
            read(x,y) from user
            if(x>=y && x>0 && y>=0):
                xcy=fac(x)/fac(y)
                xcy/=fac(x-y)
                print(xcy)
            else: print(Incorrect Input!!)
