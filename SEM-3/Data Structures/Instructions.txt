Question 1:
    1)User enters string as input.
    2)Functionality inputs:
        'Store' prints head and tail
        'Ascend'-Sorts the alphabets based on No. of Duplicates.
        'Print'-Print each alphabet with number of duplicates
        'Remove T', where T is an integer, removes extra alphabet if it occurs more than T times consecutively and prints the linkedlist
        '?' to terminate the input sequence.

Question 2:
    1)User enters a sequence of numbers and presses enter to stop entering numbers.
    2)Functionality inputs- exactly as stated in the Question.
    3) '?' to terminate the input sequence

Question 3:
    1)User enters the number of vertices and input format exactly as provided in the question,i.e, 
    2)Enter 'E' and enter two vertices and weight to add edge to the graph
      Enter 'a' and a vertex to find Neighbours of that vertex
      Enter 'b' to print all vertices
      Enter 'c' and enter two vertices to find edge weight between them
      Enter 'd' and enter a vertex to find whether that vertex exists in the graph
      Enter 'e' and enter two vertices to find whether an edge exists between them
      Enter '?' to stop the input sequence

Question 4:
    1)User enters the number of vertices and input format exactly as provided in the question,i.e, 
    2)'E u v w' - u,v,w are integers, this adds edge to the graph.
      'F'- To Find connected components in graph
      'SP src'- where src is vertex in the graph to find Shortest paths to all connected components.
    3)'?' to end the user input.

Question 5: 
    1) User enters the number of vertices and input format exactly as provided in the question,i.e,
    2) 'E u v w' - u,v,w are integers, this adds edge to the graph.
       Press any other charcter other than 'E' to terminate input.
