Instructions to compile:

Requirements:
    1. An "inp.txt" file containing only n and p values space separated.
        eg: 5 2

1. To compile Method-I and sequential algorithm:
    $ gcc Asgn1_ES18BTECH11019_mth1.c -lpthread -lm

2. To compile Method-II:
    $ gcc Asgn1_ES18BTECH11019_mth2.c -lpthread -lm 

3. To run the program.
    $ ./a.out
 
By compiling the files an output.txt file will be generated displaying the initial array, sorted array and the total time taken by respective methods.
