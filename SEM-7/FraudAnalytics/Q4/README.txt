Instructions to run:

    1) Go to the directory containing all the files.

    2) To run - $ python3 spectralClustering.py. 
       NOTE: It is advised to run the file on Google Colab by uploading required csv files,
       as all dependencies are present by default.

    3) The graph obtained is saved as 'EigenValuePlot.png'.

    4) Number of clusters, EigenValues, Number of samples in each of the clusters are printed.

        - Eigen Values are [-1.94609859e-16  3.88213187e-01  5.09068700e-01 ...  1.48503398e+00 1.49581818e+00  1.49674606e+00]
        - Number of clusters are 2
        - Number of samples in 2 clusters are:
        - Cluster 1: 352 - (Fradulent cluster)
        - Cluster 0: 847
